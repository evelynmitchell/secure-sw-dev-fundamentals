# Google docs is no longer used to propose changes

If you want to propose changes to the content, the preferred mechanisms are
[issues and pull requests via GitHub](https://github.com/ossf/secure-sw-dev-fundamentals).

The first versions of this document were developed as
[content in Google Docs form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oN6juqVR7KXuvclHvoY0pr_XQmC6t6uXMLcYphPsUsA/edit?usp=sharing), but that is no
longer how we propose and review changes to it.
